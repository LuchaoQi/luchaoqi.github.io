The final report is stored on google doc and project updates on Jira. Lessons learned: Priority: solutions &gt; problems It‚Äôs better to show results or proposals rather than technical problems / challenges incurred in the reports or presentations. Since managers are more focused on high-level output-driven problems which is defined by the nature of industry. Data: sample size / quality / feature engineering Data quality and feature engineering is the fundamental pillar in a project. Real-world data is not always ideal and will issue lots of problem during EDA e.g. unbalanced dataset / small sample size / unreliable ground truth. People usually spend most of bandwidth playing around algorithm part (hyperparameter tuning / optimization / ‚Ä¶) which of course is important. But always keep in mind that the fundamental stuff decides the upper limits of algorithm performance. Project Description: Dialysis SBIR Phase I - Research StrategyBackground: Dialysis needs AV fistula / AV graft to get better treatment and this treatment could cause stenosis. To help give diagnosis, we are trying to find a way to detect stenosis using ML/DL algorithms. Stethoscope Recordings Audio recordings of the dialysis access flow will be performed for each subject in a standardized manner. Each subject will undergo 15-second recordings first over the site of the proximal anastomosis (or the only anastomosis, in the case of an AVF), and again 4 cm and 8 cm distally along the length of the fistula or graft. Device recording location will be documented for each recording using a form embedded in the Eko App. Stethoscope sound recordings will be collected by an expert auscultator (e.g. Dr. Morrissey, Dr. Kalloo, or Dr. Lazar) with substantial experience in listening to vascular blood flow sounds, and will retake the recording if they believe the sound quality is insufficient. As the device will allow visualization of the audio waveform during recording, the recorder will receive real-time feedback on the placement of the device over the blood vessel to maximize the quality of the recording at each position. To ensure that consistent pressure is applied, the observer will balance the stethoscope chest piece on the arm such that the only pressure applied is due to the force of gravity on the chest piece. Recordings made with the Eko CORE will use the Eko CORE‚Äôs active noise canceling functionality to remove ambient noise, further improving data quality. We will plan for periodic auditing of recordings by Eko‚Äôs data science team and by Dr. Morrissey to ensure adequate data quality. We anticipate that this flexibility and real-time feedback will improve the generalizability of the use of the device to a real-world (i.e. non-study) clinical situation. AlgorithmsLiterature reviewhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FXr7skZMgN76QkAGnEfhDtdeAvS-WFRRniO0-C9rybo/edit?usp=sharing Recording-based algorithms Features based on time-domain: statistics of envelope, zero-crossings Features based on frequency domain: MFCC, band power, statistics of frequency SVM Model performance: AUC ~ 0.7, PR AUC ~ 0.2 Visit-based algorithms We tried to reproduce similar methods (mainly ratio of bandpower features + SVM) in the paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6944653 While the results are not promising, there are still some necessities digging into the paper and figure out why. Some possible reasons could the data quality/feature engineering / ‚Ä¶ Among all the features constructed, the entropy of power density (K-L divergence) across 3 locations performs the best. SVM Model performance: AUC ~0.8, PR AUC ~ 0.6 Frequency filtering The unfiltered data and filtered data (30Hz - 800Hz) are stored on AWS and the aforementioned visit-based algorithms were applied on both data but there‚Äôs no big difference between the performance. Covariates We also tried using information from ultrasound reports including flow volume, peak systolic velocity, and blood vessel diameter to predict stenosis severity but the results are not promising. Those ML results and EDA results https://github.com/EkoDevices/algorithms/blob/develop/projects/dialysis_access/notebooks/columbia_data_visualization.ipynb make the ultrasound reports less reliable. Further Analysis Dynamic Time Warping can be worth trying if there‚Äôs more data available since that‚Äôs the main way clinical experts use to give diagnosis. Useful features from clinical side: change of pulsatility / sharpness / shape / amplitude Human Annotation Project Blinded experiments are set for experts listening to audios only and give diagnosis after the listening session.More details could be found here: doc Code to reproduce the results: [code](https://github.com/EkoDevices/algorithms/blob/develop/projects/dialysis_access/notebooks/Dialysis Access Annotation Project.ipynb) The goal is to re-annotate the data and to get human level performance when they were only able to access the audio data. Results from Dr. Nicholas J. Morrissey: Problems and Possible SolutionsGround truth Data labeling is the biggest problem so far because using ultrasound reports might not be reliable. The ultrasound reports classify stenosis severity into different categories e.g. Severe, Moderate, NHSS, ‚Ä¶ which doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense when doing a sanity check. In other words, both NHSS and Severe data contain stenosis when listening to audio and even experts couldn‚Äôt differentiate between them well. Human annotation from the Columbia team shows similar results meaning that the ultrasound reports might not be enough labeling the data. Angiography should be the best solution we can find so far regarding the ground truth, especially considering the definition of stenosis (percentage change in diameter of the blood vessel). Number of recordings The ideal number of recordings would be 3 while there are occasions that the number of recordings is larger than 3 because doctors retake the recording if they believe the sound quality is insufficient. So it would be better to permit them to choose the most representative 3 recordings. There are currently ~300 recordings in total but only ~20 datasets (60 recordings) left after data cleaning for tranining. So the sample size is pretty small and we still need more enrollments. TimelineSome nitty-gritty details broken down by month December Final presentation Proposal for ground truth: angiography Final document / review Study design: further longitudinal study November Blinded experiments completed - the results are not promising and seem like experts can‚Äôt determine the stenosis severity listening to the audios only - or maybe because the definition of stenosis severity is confusing Johns Maidens Andrew Lazar Adam Saltman Nicholas J. Morrissey Include all the covariates information for the algorithm - doesn‚Äôt improve much Journal Club presentation No big difference between filtered and unfiltered (raw) data Need to figure out the definition of NHSS from ultrasound reports Internal Audit Training ML ensembling methods - not the priority Including band power related features hurts the performance Mean() / Var() on band power between recordings for each visit ROC AUC (&lt;0.5) worse than other methods October Reproduce similar methods in the paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6944653 Predict stenosis based on visits (3 recordings in and 1 out), not recordings (1 in and 1 out) - visits oriented (AUC ~ 0.8) Potential features mean / variation of central frequency and power ratio based on different thresholds (all methods mentioned in the paper) Pulsatility index (Hilbert transform) select patient and visit_index with n(recordings) == 3 for visits with more than 3 recordings, 3 of them are NHSS and 2 of them are Moderate mean/var of amplitudes / frequency group by patient_id / visit_index max/min of freq KL divergence spectrum / scipy.entropy Exploratory analysis: ratio between diameter/ flow volume / PSV instead of raw data take those ratios as the target instead of annotations from ultrasound reports?

But it would be better if experts collecting data can provide that information (Jotform). Algorithm construction: Predict stenosis using covariates only (acc ~ 0.7) Fourier Transform - MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient) Bandpower calculation and MFCCs completed. But the comparison between stenosis and non-stenosis seems not promising. Need to double check with the Columbia team regarding the data annotation part. Set up a meeting with the Columbia team and look forward to the updated spreadsheet on covariates data.
